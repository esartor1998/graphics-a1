The assignment requires you to write the routines to calculate the vertices, normals, and indices. You cannot
use a library to do thees operations other than the built-in Javascript Math object.
The assignment is to written using Javascript and WebGL. Other libraries and languages are not part of this
assignment.
If you complete the  vertex normals (the averaged normals) then hand in your assignment using them. If you
don't complete the averaged/vertex normals then submit the assignment using the surface normals (the same
normal on all three vertices for a triangle).
